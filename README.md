# Dog-breed-identification

Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

In a kaggle competition, we are provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image categorization. How well we can tell that our Norfolk Terriers are different from our Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number of training images per class, the goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo.
